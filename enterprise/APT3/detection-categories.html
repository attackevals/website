	   	<p>
			The evaluation focuses on articulating how detections occur, rather than assigning scores to vendor capabilities.</p>
		<p>
			For the evaluation, we categorize each detection and capture notes about how those detections occur. We organize detections according to each technique. Techniques may have more than one detection if the capability detects the technique in different ways, and detections we observe are included in the results. While we make every effort to capture different detections, vendor capabilities may be able to detect procedures in ways that we did not capture. For a detection to be included for a given technique, it must apply to that technique specifically (i.e. just because a detection applies to one technique in a Step or Sub-Step does not mean it applies to all techniques of that Step). For proof of detection in each category, we require that the proof be provided to us, but we may not include all detection details in public results, particularly when those details are sensitive.</p>
		<p>	
			To determine the appropriate category for a detection, we review the screenshot(s) provided, notes taken during the evaluation, results of follow-up questions to the vendor, and vendor feedback on draft results. We also independently test procedures in a separate lab environment and review open-source tool detections and forensic artifacts. This testing informs what is considered to be a detection for each technique.		</p>
		<p>
			After performing detection categorizations, we calibrate the categories across all vendors to look for discrepancies and ensure categories are applied consistently. The decision of what category to apply is ultimately based on human analysis and is therefore subject to discretion and biases inherent in all human analysis, although we do make efforts to hedge against these biases by structuring analysis as described above.</p>
		<p>	
			For the APT3 evaluation, there are nine possible detection categories. These categories are divided into two types: “Main” and “Modifier.” Each detection receives one “Main” category designation and may optionally receive one or more “Modifier” category designations.</p>	
		<p>
			<strong>We break the two category types down as follows:</strong>

                                    The vendor is unable to detect red activity due to capability limitations or other reasons. If data is available that is not directly relevant to the procedure tested, this will be categorized as “None.” In these cases, a vendor may receive a categorization of “None” with additional notes and screenshots about that data.

                                    The capability produces some minimally processed data that is accessible to an end user and directly indicates that the red team activity occurred after the user performs human analysis. There is no evidence of complex logic or an advanced rule leading to the data output, and no labeling occurs other than simple field labeling. The detection needs to be demonstrably and logically related to the actual procedure performed. Proof of detection could include the view, query, or API search used to access the data and/or the detection output (e.g., table view or process tree).

                                <strong>Detection Constraints:</strong> Telemetry is a Main detection type. The Telemetry category is only applied once per procedure, though there may be multiple ways of using different Telemetry to find the events in question.
