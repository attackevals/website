            The evaluation focuses on articulating how detections occur, rather than assigning scores to vendor
            capabilities.</p>
        <p>
            For the evaluation, we categorize each detection and capture notes about how those detections occur. We
            organize detections according to each technique. Techniques may have more than one detection if the
            capability detects the technique in different ways, and detections we observe are included in the results.
            While we make every effort to capture different detections, vendor capabilities may be able to detect
            procedures in ways that we did not capture. For a detection to be included for a given technique, it must
            apply to that technique specifically (i.e. just because a detection applies to one technique in a Step or
            Sub-Step does not mean it applies to all techniques of that Step). For proof of detection in each category,
            we require that the proof be provided to us, but we may not include all detection details in public
            results, particularly when those details are sensitive.</p>
        <p>
            To determine the appropriate category for a detection, we review the screenshot(s) provided, notes taken
            during the evaluation, results of follow-up questions to the vendor, and vendor feedback on draft results.
            We also independently test procedures in a separate lab environment and review open-source tool detections
            and forensic artifacts. This testing informs what is considered to be a detection for each technique. </p>
        <p>
            After performing detection categorizations, we calibrate the categories across all vendors to look for
            discrepancies and ensure categories are applied consistently. The decision of what category to apply is
            ultimately based on human analysis and is therefore subject to discretion and biases inherent in all human
            analysis, although we do make efforts to hedge against these biases by structuring analysis as described
            above.</p>
        <p>
            For the APT29 evaluation, there are 13 possible detection categories. These categories are divided into two types: “Main”
            and “Modifier.” Each detection receives one “Main” category designation and may optionally receive one or
            more “Modifier” category designations.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>We break the two category types down as follows:</strong>

                            These modifiers were added to identify capabilities that do not meet the threshold of an automated detection (only applied as a modifier to None). They intend to cover capabilities that are relatively common among endpoint detection and response tools.

        We differentiate between types of detection to provide more context around the capabilities a vendor offers in a way that allows end users to weigh, score, or rank the types of detection against their needs. This approach allows end users of the results to determine what they value most in a detection (e.g. some organizations may want telemetry, while others would want Technique detection). <br><br>
