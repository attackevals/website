#### ATT&CK Navigator
The ATT&CK Navigator is an open-source tool providing basic navigation and annotation of ATT&CK matrices, something that people are already doing today in tools like Excel. It is designed to be simple and generic - you can use the Navigator to visualize your defensive coverage, your red/blue team planning, the frequency of detected techniques, and more.

#### STIX
Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX<sup>&trade;</sup>) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI).

STIX enables organizations to share CTI with one another in a consistent and machine readable manner, allowing security communities to better understand what computer-based attacks they are most likely to see and to anticipate and/or respond to those attacks faster and more effectively.

STIX is designed to improve many different capabilities, such as collaborative threat analysis, automated threat exchange, automated detection and response, and more.
